## TODO

- if you do this, you can still go back and click on profile, but if you click on edit, you can no longer click on permissions or profile anymore, you can only get there if you use the browser's back button
- The number of permissions does not tally with the number of items on the list
- The filters for permission are not working
- Users can't click on permissions and profile after clicking on edit
- Take out the statistics on the dashboard
- Work on the design and functionality of the search button

## Done

- Hide search component until completed.
- Authentication container too narrow on mobile
